<h1>Independent Practice</h1>
<h2> This is where I practice all the things that we have learned today</h2>
<p>
    We have started with HTML. So far, we have learned how to do headings, paragraphs, and now line breaks.
    <br>
    We hve also done links to other pages, drop down buttons which uses the select and options function and how to
    create buttons. We have also done images and
    links to websites out of the codebase I am building.
</p>

    Here is an image of a calico cat.
